# Connect 4 Software agent
This repository contains the implementation of a software agent designed to play the game Connect 4. 
It was developed as a task for the "Programming Project in Python" course at TU Berlin. 
The primary objective was to implement and design an intelligent agent capable of playing Connect 4 using the Minimax algorithm and then upgrade it with more advanced methodologies.

## Project Components

1. Core Utility Functions: Implementing the core utility functions, sufficient to play against another human 
2. Random Playing: Developing an agent capable of making random moves.
2. Minimax Algorithm Prototyping: Designing and implementing a functional prototype utilizing the Minimax algorithm to enable the software agent to play Connect 4 effectively.
3. Advanced Approaches Exploration: Exploring advanced methodologies such as gradient-based learning and reinforcement learning to enhance the agent's capabilities. I choose reinforcement learning and this exploration is continued in a separate repository. -> https://github.com/t-kolev/Connect-4-NN
